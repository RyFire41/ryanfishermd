## Open Enrollment 2025: Smarter Choices With Insurance and Direct Primary Care

Open enrollment is when you lock in next year’s healthcare access and costs. You are choosing between trade‑offs: network size vs. price, predictable costs vs. flexibility, convenience vs. out‑of‑pocket risk. This guide simplifies the process and adds an often‑overlooked option: **Direct Primary Care (DPC)**, which can stand alone for everyday care, but generally provides the best protection and value when paired with a catastrophic or high‑deductible HSA‑eligible plan for financial security.

## 1: First Principles: What actually drives your total cost

A plan’s marketing highlights premiums and deductibles. Your **true** annual exposure is better framed by the **Wacasey Equation (source: ********************************************[The Wacasey Equation](http://wikibin.org/articles/the-wacasey-equation-3.html)********************************************, by Kevin Wacasey, M.D.)**:

**P + O = T**

- **P** = Annual **Premiums** you pay
- **O** = **Out‑of‑Pocket maximum** (your worst‑case medical spend, excluding premiums)
- **T** = Maximum **Total** you could pay in a bad year

***Implications***:

- A lower **deductible** does not always lower **T**. If premiums rise enough, you may still pay more overall.
- Compare plans by **T** (worst‑case) and by a **likely‑case** scenario (based on your expected care use), not just by premium.
- Confirm what **counts** toward the out‑of‑pocket maximum (most medical services in‑network; often excludes premiums, balance bills, some non‑covered services).

> Use the equation to shortlist 2–3 plans with the lowest **T** that still meet your clinical needs and provider access.

## 2) Coverage Models: HMO, PPO, EPO, HDHP, and DPC

### Traditional insurance

- **HMO**: Lowest premiums. Strict in‑network rules. Referrals required. Predictable for routine care if your providers are in‑network.
- **PPO**: Highest flexibility. Out‑of‑network coverage at higher cost. Often higher premiums.
- **EPO**: Middle ground. No out‑of‑network coverage except emergencies. Lower premium than PPO, fewer choices than PPO.
- **HDHP (HSA‑eligible)**: Lower premiums, higher deductibles. Works best if you can fund an **HSA** for tax‑advantaged savings. Verify what services are **pre‑deductible** (e.g., preventive care) and what isn’t.

### Direct Primary Care (DPC)

**What it is:** A monthly membership (not insurance) that gives you unlimited primary care access with transparent pricing. Typical features: same/next‑day visits, longer appointments, virtual care, wholesale labs and meds, chronic disease management, and proactive prevention.

**Where it fits:**

- **Stand‑alone for routine care** if you rarely use the broader system and accept financial risk for specialist/hospital care.
- **Paired with insurance** to improve access and reduce total cost of common care (e.g., DPC + **HDHP** or DPC + **catastrophic/bronze** plan). Many members find fewer urgent care visits and better control of chronic conditions.

**Money mechanics:**

- The DPC **membership fee** is separate from premiums and does **not** apply to your insurance **OOP max**.
- HSA rules are nuanced. According to updated IRS guidance and other federal resources, certain DPC arrangements may qualify as permissible medical expenses if structured properly, but paying DPC fees can still affect HSA eligibility depending on plan design and service scope. Always review the most recent IRS publications and verify compliance with a qualified tax advisor, benefits administrator, or attorney.
- Employers can pair DPC with **ICHRA/QSEHRA** allowances; individuals can pair DPC with marketplace plans. Confirm local availability.

**Limitations:** DPC is not insurance, does not replace specialist/hospital coverage, and usually does not bill insurance for its services.

## 3) Network, Access, and Prior Authorization (PA)

1. **In‑network providers and hospitals:** Verify your PCP, specialists, hospital, and **pharmacy** are in‑network. Use the insurer’s tool and call offices to confirm active participation.
2. **Prior authorization rules:** Identify services that require PA (advanced imaging, specialty meds, therapies, DME). Ask about typical turnaround and appeals.
3. **Therapy caps and visit limits:** PT/OT/ST often have caps or PA triggers. Know the rules before you need care.
4. **DME coverage:** Confirm contracted vendors and rental vs. purchase rules for CPAP, braces, glucose monitors, etc.

> If you join a DPC, ask what the clinic can provide at membership pricing (e.g., stitches, labs, generic meds) to avoid claims and PA friction.

---

## 4) Medications: Formularies and cost tiers

- Search your exact drugs and dosages in each plan’s **formulary**. Note **tiers**, **step therapy**, and **PA** flags.
- Calculate annual medication cost under each plan. Consider manufacturer assistance programs where applicable.
- Ask your DPC clinic whether they dispense common generics at wholesale pricing and how that compares to plan copays.

---

## 5) Medicare choices: Original + Part D vs. Medicare Advantage (MA)

- **Original Medicare + Part D (+ Medigap)**: Broad provider choice. Fewer PA hurdles. Separate drug plan. Medigap premiums add cost but reduce variability.
- **Medicare Advantage**: Lower monthly premium options. Extra benefits (dental/vision/OTC), but tighter networks and more PA requirements. Out‑of‑area care can be limited to emergencies.
- **Sales incentives:** MA brokers and agents are compensated by plans. Treat pitches as advertising. Verify details on **Medicare.gov**.
- **DPC with Medicare:** Many DPC practices opt out of Medicare billing; you pay the DPC fee directly. Confirm how referrals, imaging, and hospital care flow under your Medicare choice.

## 6) Out‑of‑area rules for multi‑state living

Snowbirds and frequent travelers should check:

- Non‑emergency out‑of‑area coverage (often limited in HMOs/EPOs and MA).
- Telehealth availability across state lines.
- National pharmacy networks and urgent‑care partnerships.
- How DPC handles remote care and prescriptions when you are away.

---

## 7) Star ratings, reviews, and real‑world fit

- **Star ratings** offer signal on quality and operations but are not clinical guarantees.
- Read **consumer reviews** and ask local clinicians about practical access: appointment lag, referral friction, claim denials.
- With DPC, assess **panel size**, same‑day access rate, communication channels, and included services.

---

## 8) Compare plans with two scenarios

Create a simple two‑row comparison for each option:

**A) Likely‑use year**

- Premiums (P)
- Typical visits, meds, tests, therapy
- DPC membership (if used)
- Expected out‑of‑pocket before any max

**B) Worst‑case year**

- Premiums (P)
- Out‑of‑pocket maximum (O)
- DPC membership (still due)
- **T = P + O + DPC fees** (since DPC is outside insurance)

Shortlist the 1–2 options with the best total value in both scenarios **and** the access you need.

## 9) Action checklist before you enroll

**Documents to Gather:**

- Summary of Benefits and Coverage (SBC) for each plan
- Full policy or Evidence of Coverage (EOC)
- Provider and pharmacy directories (download or print)
- List of current medications, dosages, and preferred pharmacies
- Current and projected healthcare expenses for the next year
- Prior year Explanation of Benefits (EOBs) or claims summary
- IRS Publication 969 and recent HSA eligibility guidance
- Documentation for DPC membership terms, fees, and services covered

**Key Factors to Consider:**

- **Total** annual cost using **P + O (+ DPC fees)** for each plan
- Network adequacy for your providers and facilities
- Prior authorization and referral requirements
- Prescription drug tier placement and coverage limits
- DME supplier access and pricing
- Out-of-area emergency and urgent care coverage
- Compatibility of DPC with HDHP/HSA rules
- Employer contributions to HSA or HRA accounts
- Impact on dependents, especially college students or dual-state households

**Verification Steps:**

- Contact HR or the plan administrator to confirm enrollment deadlines
- Check for telehealth and mental health coverage specifics
- Confirm that preventive care and vaccines are covered at no cost
- Review renewal or opt-out requirements for existing plans
- Keep digital and paper copies of all plan documents and confirmations

## Bottom line

Insurance manages **financial risk**. DPC maximizes **primary care access and continuity**. Many households benefit from pairing them: a low‑premium plan to cap catastrophic costs, plus DPC for convenient, proactive primary care that reduces downstream spending. Use the Wacasey lens for worst‑case cost, verify network and PA rules for real‑world usability, and choose the combination that keeps you healthy while protecting your budget.

## Call to action 

Take one evening to verify networks, price your meds, and run the worst‑ vs likely‑year math. If DPC is available, price a pair: **Bronze/HDHP + DPC** vs. your current plan. Choose, enroll, and save your docs before the deadline.

## Understanding the 2026 Part D Cost Structure

| **Stage**               | **What You Pay**                        | **2026 Key Details**                                 |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Deductible**       | 100% until deductible met               | **Up to \$615** maximum (plans may set lower or \$0) |
| **2. Initial Coverage** | Typically 25% while plan pays about 75% | Continues until your **OOP reaches \$2,100**         |
| **3. Post-OOP Cap**     | **\$0** for covered Part D drugs        | Applies to the rest of the calendar year             |

## The Medicare Prescription Payment Plan (Smoothing)

### What It Is

An **optional** way to **spread OOP drug costs** across the year in fixed monthly bills, instead of paying large amounts at the pharmacy early in the year.

### Who Qualifies

- Everyone enrolled in **Medicare Part D (PDP)** or **Medicare Advantage-Part D**(**MA-PD)** plans.
- No income or drug-type restriction.

### Enrollment Windows

- **Open Enrollment:** Oct 15–Dec 7, 2025, for a Jan 1, 2026 start.
- **Midyear:** You can opt in later; the plan spreads remaining costs over remaining months.

### How Monthly Payments Are Calculated

1. The plan estimates what you would otherwise pay out of pocket for covered drugs, up to the **\$2,100** cap.
2. It divides that amount evenly over the remaining months.
3. You pay the fixed bill to your plan each month; at the pharmacy, you pay **\$0** for covered fills while enrolled in smoothing.
4. Year-end **reconciliation** adjusts for over/under payments.

> **Example A (January enrollment):** Estimated OOP \$1,920 → **\$160/month** × 12.\
> **Example B (March enrollment):** Estimated OOP \$1,750 with 10 months left → **\~\$175/month**.

### Missed Payments

- Plans provide grace notices; persistent nonpayment can end smoothing, and you’ll owe the remaining balance. Coverage under Part D continues if you remain enrolled in the plan.

### Plan Obligations

- Offer online/phone enrollment, disclose schedule within **5 business days** of request, and provide monthly statements and balances, consistent with CMS instructions.

## Extra Help (LIS) in 2026

- If you qualify, premiums and most cost-sharing are greatly reduced.
- Many LIS enrollees won’t approach the **\$2,100** cap. Apply via **SSA.gov**.

---

## Vaccines and Insulin

- **Vaccines:** \$0 for ACIP-recommended adult vaccines under Part D.
- **Insulin:** **\$35/month** cap for each **covered** insulin for a one-month supply, even before the deductible. Plans are not required to cover every insulin; verify your exact product and dosage form are on your plan’s formulary.

---

## Appeals and Exceptions (Basics)

- **Coverage determination → redetermination → IRE** if needed.
- Ask for tiering exceptions, PA waivers, and quantity-limit overrides when clinically justified.

---

## Open Enrollment Dates (for 2026 coverage)

- **Oct 15–Dec 7, 2025:** Choose/change plans.
- **Jan 1, 2026:** Coverage starts.
- **Jan 1–Mar 31, 2026:** MA Open Enrollment Period.
